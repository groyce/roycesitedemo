        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
           I started my career as a high school science teacher a number of years ago.
           I was also interested in how I could improve my class so I introduced
           student feedback and criterion referenced tests in my science classes
           to help me improve my classes each year.  This led to a PhD with an
           emphasis on test and measurements.  In order to complete my dissertation
           and other research I was doing at the time, I needed to become familiar
           with computers.  I took many classes to become proficient with the
           technology.  This led to a change in my career.  I became a
           programmer analyst at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
           I spent three years supporting academic research at UNMC as well as
           the medical information systems used by the hospital and the Internal
           Medicine department.  From UNMC, I went to Mutual of Omaha as a systems
            analyst.
        </p>
        <p>
            I retired in 2013 from Mutual of Omaha. I held several positions including the
            Vice President of Enterprise Architecture (CTO) and Security (CISO). In that role was the
            chief architect and the chief information security officer for Mutual of Omaha. Over a 29-year
            period, I have focused on the deployment of strategic technologies in support of key
            business projects.  This has included the introduction of client server and then later web
            technology in the companies. I have also led the effort to bring in document management
            and workflow technologies. Business projects supported by Strategic Technology Development
            also included PeopleSoft ERP and Group Insurance Administration and Claims Processing
            Systems as well web technology to support Mutual’s web presence including the Sales
            Professional Access Portal and ecommerce capabilities.  We also deployed a business rule engine
            to automate decision-making.  To accomplish these large projects, a central project management
            team was formed in 1998.  I was the founding manager of the team and developed many early
            processes to support the matrix organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also teach graduate courses in information technology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha
            and Creighton University.  They include Managing Distributed Systems, Enterprise Application
            Integration, Business Process Management, Enterprise Content and Document Management and
            Innovation and Managing Emerging Technologies.
